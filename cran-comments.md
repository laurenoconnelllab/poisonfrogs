## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Confirmed that there are no external publications describing the methods implemented in this package; therefore no references were added to the DESCRIPTION.

* Removed all uses of \dontrun{} in the examples. Runnable examples are now unwrapped.  

* Changed the single-quoted 'ggplot2' to undirected quotes in the DESCRIPTION file.

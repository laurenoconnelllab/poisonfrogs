`poisonfrogs` is a extensive collection of colour palettes inspired in species and morphs of Neotropical poison frogs. And more and more...

## Installation

You can install the development version of poisonfrogs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("laurenoconnelllab/poisonfrogs")
```

or with:

```{r example}
install.packages("poisonfrogs")
```

## Example

I will make nice examples here. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
